This repo is a public collection of Fused User Defined Functions (UDFs). 

Fused is the glue layer that interfaces data platforms and data tools via a managed serverless API. With Fused, you can write, share, or discover UDFs which are the building blocks of serverless geospatial operations. UDFs are Python functions that turn into live HTTP endpoints that load their output into any tools that can call an API.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Fused Python SDK

The Fused Python SDK is available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fused/). Use the standard Python [installation tools](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/). UDFs this repo expect a version `>=1.2.0`.

```bash
pip install fused
```

### 2. Import a UDF into a workflow

This snippet shows how to import a UDF from a Python environment and their modules from a public GitHub URL. The URL must be of a directory that contains a UDF generated with Fused. This example shows how to import a UDF.

```python
utils = fused.core.import_from_github('https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/common/').udf
udf(...)
```

## Walkthrough

### Repo structure

This repository is structured to facilitate easy access of UDFs and their supporting files. Each UDF, like `Sample_UDF`, is contained within its own subdirectory within the `public` directory - along with its documentation, code, metadata, and utility function code. 

Each UDF can be thought of as a standalone Python package.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ public
    â””â”€â”€ Sample_UDF
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.MD
        â”œâ”€â”€ Sample_UDF.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ meta.json
        â””â”€â”€ utils.py
```

Files relevant to each UDF are:
- `README.md` Provides details of the UDF's purpose and how it works.
- `Sample_UDF.py` This eponymous Python file contains the UDF's business logic as a Python function decorated with `@fused.udf`.
- `meta.json` This file contains metadata needed to render the UDF in the Fused explorer and for the UDF to run correctly.
- `utils.py` This Python file contains helper functions the UDF (optionally) imports and references.



### Contribute a UDF

1. Save UDF

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def my_udf():
    return "Hello from Fused!"

# Save locally
my_udf.save('my_udf', where='local')

# Save remotely to Fused
my_udf.save('my_udf', where='remote')
```

"Save locally" generates the UDF folder on your local system, which you'll use in the following step.

2. Open a PR


Clone this repo to your local system and introduce the UDF folder under `public`. Create a PR on this repo.
