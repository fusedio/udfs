It is intended to provide enough lead time so that those who need to set their plans in motion can do so.\n\n**Warning**\n: A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or property.\n\n**Advisory**\n: The expected weather condition has a pretty good chance of occurring, even a likely chance of occurring, but typically an advisory is used for less severe type of weather conditions. A Wind Advisory might be issued or a Freezing Rain Advisory issued instead of a High Wind Warning or an ice Storm Warning.\n\n# External links\n* [NWS Weather & Hazard Data Viewer](https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/)\n* [NWS Watch/Warning/Advisory (WWA) FeatureServer](https://mapservices.weather.noaa.gov/eventdriven/rest/services/WWA/watch_warn_adv/FeatureServer)\n* [h3-py Polygon Tutorial](https://uber.github.io/h3-py/polygon_tutorial.html)\n",
