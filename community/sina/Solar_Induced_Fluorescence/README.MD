# Solar Induced Fluorescence

Visualize global photosynthesis with this solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) dataset. The dataset bridges satellite and ground-based photosynthesis measurements, unlocking new insights into Earth's biomes.

Covering September 2014 to July 2020, this dataset provides 16-day mean SIF estimates at 0.05Â° (5 km) resolution using an ANN trained on OCO-2 and MODIS data. Adjust the "month", "year" and "period" parameter to explore SIF patterns by time, supporting applications like drought monitoring, yield estimation, and agricultural planning.
