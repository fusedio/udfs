### Overview: Simple trips simulation using GeoPandas and OSMnx. 
Designed to address the challenges faced by cities with limited resources for urban planning, this tool models trips based on real-world population density, zoning data, and road networks. With parameters such as trip schedules, origins, and destinations, the tool calculates travel paths.

Future enhancements aim to expand the toolâ€™s capabilities, including support for custom and larger areas of interest, multimodal routing (walking, biking, driving, transit), and metrics for evaluating mobility outcomes. By empowering planners with cost-effective simulations, this project helps inform critical infrastructure decisions, such as optimizing transit routes or assessing the impact of new road networks. Stay tuned for updates and a demo to explore its potential!
