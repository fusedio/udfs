With parameters such as trip schedules, origins, and destinations, the tool calculates travel paths.\n\nFuture enhancements aim to expand the toolâ€™s capabilities, including support for custom and larger areas of interest, multimodal routing (walking, biking, driving, transit), and metrics for evaluating mobility outcomes. By empowering planners with cost-effective simulations, this project helps inform critical infrastructure decisions, such as optimizing transit routes or assessing the impact of new road networks. Stay tuned for updates and a demo to explore its potential!\n\n## External links\n\n- [Code reference link](https://github.com/Claudio9701/TripsSimulator)\n\n",
