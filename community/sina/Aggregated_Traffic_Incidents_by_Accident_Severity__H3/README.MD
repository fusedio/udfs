Visualizing Traffic Accident Severity in Germany

🔍 What It Shows:
Each hexagon on the map represents an aggregated view of traffic accident data for that specific area:

 • Green hexagons indicate areas where accidents with slight injuries are most common.
 • Orange hexagons represent areas with a higher occurrence of serious injuries.
 • Red hexagons highlight zones with fatalities, marking critical areas for potential safety improvements.

📈 How We Built It:
Using Fused’s powerful geospatial tools, we:

 1. Aggregated 270,000+ traffic incident records by location and accident severity, grouping them into hexagons.
 2. Dynamically mapped each hexagon’s color based on the predominant accident severity, allowing for easy, high-level insights.
 3. Achieved near-instant processing times, enabling rapid updates and real-time data exploration.

🚀 Why This Matters:
With this kind of data-driven visualization, city planners, public safety officials, and transportation authorities can quickly identify high-risk areas. This helps to inform decisions on resource allocation, targeted safety campaigns, and road infrastructure improvements.
