Calculates Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) data for U.S. counties with a focus on crop-specific insights using USDA Cropland Data Layers. Computes key SIF metrics—sums, means, and ratios—for crops (e.g., corn) and non-crop areas by masking a NetCDF with GeoTiff. Users can customize parameters such as year, month, period, and county FIPS codes to track temporal and spatial trends. The result is a GeoDataFrame with detailed, spatially-referenced statistics, supporting applications in crop yield prediction, drought monitoring, and agricultural planning.
