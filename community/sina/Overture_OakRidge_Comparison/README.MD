## Overview

This UDF performs a spatial join between the Overture Buildings and Oak Ridge Buildings datasets, using Oak Ridge data to fill in gaps in Overtureâ€™s building categories. Note that Oak Ridge coverage is limited to the USA.

Set the 'metric' parameter to view data from Overture, Oak Ridge, or both combined.
