#### Overview
The Copernicus DEM is a digital surface model (DSM), which represents the surface of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure, and vegetation. This DSM is based on radar satellite data acquired during the TanDEM-X Mission, which was funded by a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and Airbus Defence and Space.


Copernicus DEM is available at both 30-meter and 90-meter resolution.
