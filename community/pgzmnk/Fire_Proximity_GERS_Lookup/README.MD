## GERS Lookup

This UDF receives a GERS and returns a fire risk rating. The rating is calculated with a buffer to represent proximity to a fire from the [WFIGS Current Interagency Fire Perimeters](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::wfigs-current-interagency-fire-perimeters/about) dataset.
